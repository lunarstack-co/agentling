# Releasing agentling

The pipeline is small: bump the version, validate, dry-run on TestPyPI, publish
to PyPI, then tag and cut a GitHub release. Versions on PyPI and TestPyPI are
**permanent and non-reusable**, which is why the dry run matters.

## 1. Prepare

- [ ] On `main`, working tree clean (release from `main` after the PR merges).
- [ ] Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml`.
- [ ] Add a `## [x.y.z]` section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] The gate is green:

  ```bash
  uv run pytest
  uv run ruff check src tests examples
  uv run ruff format --check src tests examples
  uv run mypy src tests examples
  ```

## 2. Build and write the release notes

```bash
rm -rf dist && uv build
uv run --with twine twine check dist/*
```

Write the version's summary once and reuse it for the tag and the GitHub
release. Keep it in step with the `CHANGELOG.md` entry:

```bash
cat > /tmp/vX.Y.Z-notes.md <<'EOF'
vX.Y.Z — <one-line theme>

<short paragraph>

Highlights:
- ...

Full changelog: CHANGELOG.md
EOF
```

## 3. Handle the token securely

Never put a token on the command line or in a file (shell and git history are
forever). Read it into an env var at a silent prompt; uv reads
`UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`:

```bash
read -rs UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN && export UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN
# Verify without revealing it (length + harmless prefix only):
echo "length: ${#UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN} | prefix: ${UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN:0:5}"   # want ~150-200 and 'pypi-'
```

TestPyPI and PyPI use **separate** tokens. `unset UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN` before
switching between them, and again when done. The first-ever upload of a new
project needs an account-scoped token; use a project-scoped token afterward.

## 4. Dry run on TestPyPI

```bash
uv publish --publish-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```

Install it back in a throwaway environment. Install the dependencies from PyPI
first, then agentling alone from TestPyPI. A single command with
`--extra-index-url` does not work: uv searches the extra index first and stops
at the first index that has the package, so it finds an older agentling on
PyPI. Installing in two steps also keeps dependencies off TestPyPI, where
anyone can upload a package under any name.

```bash
uv venv /tmp/testpypi
uv pip install --python /tmp/testpypi -r pyproject.toml
uv pip install --python /tmp/testpypi --no-deps \
  --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ "agentling==X.Y.Z"
/tmp/testpypi/bin/python -c "import agentling; print(agentling.__version__)"
unset UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN && rm -rf /tmp/testpypi
```

## 5. Publish to PyPI

```bash
read -rs UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN && export UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN   # PyPI token this time
uv publish                                             # default target is real PyPI
unset UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN
```

Confirm a clean-environment install:

```bash
uv venv /tmp/pypi
uv pip install --python /tmp/pypi agentling
/tmp/pypi/bin/python -c "import agentling; print(agentling.__version__)"
rm -rf /tmp/pypi
```

## 6. Tag and release

Use an **annotated** tag so the tag itself carries the summary (`git show
vX.Y.Z` prints it), and reuse the same notes file for the GitHub release:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -F /tmp/vX.Y.Z-notes.md
git push origin vX.Y.Z                                 # tags are not pushed by a normal push
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file /tmp/vX.Y.Z-notes.md
```
